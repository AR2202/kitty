please enter your code
you can do arithmetic expressions
like addition and multiplication, e.g. 
2 + 3 * (4 + 1)
or you can define variables like
myvariable = 5
and use the variable later
myvariable * 3 
you can use decimal numbers, e.g.
mydecimal = 0.56
but you can't add decimal numbers to whole numbers
this won't work:
mydecimal + 2
but this will:
mydecimal + 2.0
